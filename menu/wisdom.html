            What comes to mind when thinking about Ramen ...
          </h1>
          <p>
            In Japan, apart from ramen, various type of cooking using noodles
            such as udon or soba can be found. The big difference is that
            Chinese noodles are used when cooking ramen. The Chinese noodles are
            made using 'kansui', a special alkaline solution that will give a
            different color, mouthfeel and flavor to the noodles. A few
            restaurants are making their noodles without 'kansui', but generally
            speaking noodles made without 'kansui' are classified in the udon
            category in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, you can guess that the most important thing in Ramen
            are the noodles. When thinking about ramen we always have a tendency
            to think about the soup, but you should definitely pay attention to
            the noodles' flavor when eating ramen.

              <p>
                The most common Ramen that you can eat in Japan is
                <strong>Shoyu Ramen</strong>. It seems that the first ramen shop
                in Asakusa, Tokyo was offering a shoyu ramen more than 100 years
                ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shoyu Ramen is made by mixing the dashi soup, extracted of pork
                bones, chicken bones or seafood among others, with the
                shoyu-based sauce. However, remember that there are many
                varieties of shoyu and dashi soup depending on the ramen
                restaurant or the region. That's why shoyu ramen has a wide
                variety of flavors. And depending on which type of ramen noodles
                you are mixing with the soup, the eating exprience can differ
                big-time.

              <h1 class="title">Shio Ramen</h1>
              <p>
                Generally speacking, <strong>shio ramen</strong> is a lightly
                seasoned ramen soup using salt in its sauce. Because salt
                doesn't have a color like shoyu or miso, the dashi soup can stay
                transparent.
              </p>
              <p>
                When comparing shio ramen to shoyu ramen or miso ramen, it is
                easier to express the characteristics of each ingredients.ã€€It
                is said that you can't cheat when making a shio ramen. Nowadays,
                a lot of shio ramen have a robust flavor thanks to the generous
                umami of their sauce and dashi soup.

              <p>
                There are not as much miso ramen restaurants as shoyu or shio
                ramen restaurants, but Japanese are really familiar with miso
                ramen. It is certainly due to the huge contribution of Hokkaido
                Sapporo Miso ramen. By mixing miso, veggies and dashi soup in a
                pot, the unique flavor of miso ramen can be expressed.

              <p>
                <strong>Tonkotsu ramen</strong> is widely known in Kyushu and
                its soup is made of pork bones. Simmering for a long time pork
                bones makes the soup generally cloudy. Its thickness and taste
                vary according to the simmering time and the pork parts that are
                being used.
              </p>
              <p>
                When making this type of ramen, thin noodles are used and
                because the noodles' quantity is relatively small, especially in
                Hakata - Fukuoka prefecture, Kyushu area - there are a lot of
                restaurants who are offering second serving of only noodles. The
                use of garlic is also quite common in the tonkotsu ramen of
                every regions in Kyushu.

                obtained after simmering chicken and chicken bones for a long

              <h1 class="title">Tsukemen</h1>
              <p>
                <strong>Tsukemen</strong> are noodles that you eat by dipping
                them into a soup. Normally, ramen are boiled noodles put
                together into a hot soup. Tsukemen are boiled noodles that will
                be cooled downed with cold water and put into a separate plate.
                The soup is also in a separate bowl.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tsukemen was thought so that noodles become the main part of the
                dish. They are generally thicker than normal noodles. However,
                the soup doesn't lose to noodles and is normally thick. That's
                why after eating the noodles, you can sometimes thin down the
                soup with a dashi and drink it depending on the restaurant's
                system.

              <h1 class="title">Mazesoba</h1>
              <p>
                To put it simply, <strong>Mazesoba</strong> is a ramen without
                soup. You might find it weird to consider it a ramen when there
                is no soup, but in Japan it has become quite popular.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eating it with a sauce is one of its characteristics. You should
                eat it after mixing it well with the sauce because it's easy for
                the sauce to get stuck at the bottom of the bowl. Because there
                is no soup, it's less caloric than a normal ramen.

              <p>
                Chashu is a chunk of cooked pork coated with a sauce and is a must when it comes to ramen.
                Chicken or other type of meat can also be used when making chashu. 
              <p>
                Depending on the region or the restarant, 
                the piece of meat used, the cooking method and the sauce are different.
                Recently, technique such as the French low temperature cooking method is used a lot so that 
                the meat can looked juicy and fresher.

                Menma is a unique topping to Ramen that can't be found in udon or soba dishes. It is made by 
                salting the boiled bamboo shoots and letting them ferment.

              <p>
                Menma should normaly be big and tough, but nowadays, we can often eat menma that were cooked usinge
                the tender part of the tip of the bamboo. Menma are also quite popular as an an hors d'oeuvre  that goes 
                well with alcohol.
