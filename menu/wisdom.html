            What comes to mind when thinking about Ramen ...
          </h1>
          <p>
            In Japan, apart from ramen, various type of cooking using noodles
            such as udon or soba can be found. The big difference is that
            Chinese noodles are used when cooking ramen. The Chinese noodles are
            made using 'kansui', a special alkaline solution that will give a
            different color, mouthfeel and flavor to the noodles. A few
            restaurants are making their noodles without 'kansui', but generally
            speaking noodles made without 'kansui' are classified in the udon
            category in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, you can guess that the most important thing in Ramen
            are the noodles. When thinking about ramen we always have a tendency
            to think about the soup, but you should definitely pay attention to
            the noodles' flavor when eating ramen.

                The most common Ramen that you can eat in Japan is
                <strong>Shoyu Ramen</strong>. It seems that the first ramen shop
                in Asakusa, Tokyo was offering a shoyu ramen more than 100 years
                ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shoyu Ramen is made by mixing the dashi soup, extracted of pork
                bones, chicken bones or seafood among others, with the
                shoyu-based sauce. However, remember that there are many
                varieties of shoyu and dashi soup depending on the ramen
                restaurant or the region. That's why shoyu ramen has a wide
                variety of flavors. And depending on which type of ramen noodles
                you are mixing with the soup, the eating exprience can differ
                big-time.

              <p>
                Generally speacking, <strong>shio ramen</strong> is a lightly
                seasoned ramen soup using salt in its sauce. Because salt
                doesn't have a color like shoyu or miso, the dashi soup can stay
                transparent.
              </p>
              <p>
                When comparing shio ramen to shoyu ramen or miso ramen, it is
                easier to express the characteristics of each ingredients.ã€€It
                is said that you can't cheat when making a shio ramen. Nowadays,
                a lot of shio ramen have a robust flavor thanks to the generous
                umami of their sauce and dashi soup.

                There are not as much miso ramen restaurants as shoyu or shio
                ramen restaurants, but Japanese are really familiar with miso
                ramen. It is certainly due to the huge contribution of Hokkaido
                Sapporo Miso ramen. By mixing miso, veggies and dashi soup in a
                pot, the unique flavor of miso ramen can be expressed.

                <strong>Tonkotsu ramen</strong> is widely known in Kyushu and its soup is made of pork bones. Simmering for a long time pork bones makes the soup generally cloudy.
                Its thickness and taste vary according to the simmering time and the pork parts that are being used.
              </p>
              <p>
        When making this type of ramen, thin noodles are used and because the noodles' quantity is relatively small, especially in Hakata - Fukuoka prefecture, Kyushu area - there are a lot 
        of restaurants who are offering second serving of only noodles. The use of garlic is also quite common in the tonkotsu ramen of every regions in Kyushu.

            Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It
            has to happen. You lookâ€¦perfect. I'm really more an apartment
            person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me.

            I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm
            not part of. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone
            wears a mask â€¦ not just me. This man is a knight in shining armor.

            Keep your mind limber. I'm partial to air conditioning. I will not
            kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my
            sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will
            not kill my sister.

            Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is
            computerized. I'm partial to air conditioning. I like seafood. I
            feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure
            what the picture should be.

            I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm Dexter, and I'm not
            sure what I am. I am not a killer. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I
            feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure
            what the picture should be.

            Watching ice melt. This is fun. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm
            really more an apartment person. I'm real proud of you for coming,
            bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer. Somehow, I doubt
            that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

            Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
            The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad
            things.â€¦hey.â€¦the good things don't always soften the bad things; but
            vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things
            and make them unimportant.

            You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are
            cool. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. All I've got to
            do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly
            go wrong?

            They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! You've swallowed a planet!
            Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the Doctor, and you are
            the Daleks! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

            I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself*
            And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I'm the Doctor. Well,
            they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too.
            I still don't know why.
