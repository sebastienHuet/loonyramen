                The most common Ramen that you can eat in Japan is the
                <strong>Shoyu Ramen</strong>. It seems that the first ramen shop
                in Asakusa, Tokyo was offering a shoyu ramen more than 100 years

                Shoyu Ramen is made by mixing the dashi soup, extracted of pork
                bones, chicken bones or seafood among others, with the
                shoyu-based sauce. However, remember that there are many
                varieties of shoyu and dashi soup depending on the ramen
                restaurant or the region. That's why shoyu ramen has a wide
                variety of flavors. And depending on which type of ramen noodles
                you are mixing with the soup, the eating exprience can differ
                big-time.

            Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Kid, I've flown from one

            Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the
            worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within
            minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Thank you,

            I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart,
            powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Son, a woman is like a
            beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own
            mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink
            another woman!

            I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I
            won't be back for ten minutes! Human contact: the final frontier.
            And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. I'll be back. You
            can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when
            they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

            I didn't get rich by signing checks. No children have ever meddled
            with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. "Thank the
            Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God
            has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place
            within an organized religion.

            No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to
            tell about it. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic,

            taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!

            Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm

            a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!

            I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm
            not part of. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone
            wears a mask … not just me. This man is a knight in shining armor.

            Keep your mind limber. I'm partial to air conditioning. I will not
            kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my
            sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will
            not kill my sister.

            Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is
            computerized. I'm partial to air conditioning. I like seafood. I
            feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure
            what the picture should be.

            I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm Dexter, and I'm not
            sure what I am. I am not a killer. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I
            feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure
            what the picture should be.

            Watching ice melt. This is fun. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm
            really more an apartment person. I'm real proud of you for coming,
            bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer. Somehow, I doubt
            that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

            Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
            The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad
            things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but
            vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things
            and make them unimportant.

            You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are
            cool. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. All I've got to
            do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly
            go wrong?

            They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You've swallowed a planet!
            Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the Doctor, and you are
            the Daleks! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

            I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself*
            And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I'm the Doctor. Well,
            they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too.
            I still don't know why.
