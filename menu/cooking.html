            Soon enough. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Oh, how I wish I could
            believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of
            action now: kill Flexo! It doesn't look so shiny to me. No, she'll
            probably make me do it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger
            problems. We're rescuing ya. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band
            doesn't rock. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with
            all the bed making you'll be doing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Oh, all right, I am.
            <strong>
              But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old
              man.</strong
            >
            <em> Pansy.</em> Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Why would a robot need to drink? I haven't felt much of anything
            since my guinea pig died. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Oh sure!
            Blame the wizards! But existing is basically all I do!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the
            dead. Tell her she looks thin. Oh, I think we should just stay
            friends. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in
            the known universe!
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o'
              trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community
              service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me.
              Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>
            It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen
            seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like
            fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty
            his bowels. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make
            you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Shut up and take my money! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in
            Farnsworth's court! I don't want to be rescued. Man, I'm sore all
            over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

            <li>
              Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired
              to promote alcoholic beverages!

            Leela's gonna kill me. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but
            you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Oh right. I
            forgot about the battle. No! The cat shelter's on to me. For the
            last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who
            liked lilacs!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only
            used to download pornography. Incidentally, you have a dime up your
            nose. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM
            LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then we'll go with that data file! Now Fry, it's been a few years
            since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species:
            fatal or non-fatal? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day,

            Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery
            can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… There, now he's
            trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling
            errors!
          </p>

            Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yes. You
            gave me a dollar and some candy. No, she'll probably make me do it.
            Bender?! You stole the atom. That's the ONLY thing about being a
            slave.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You don't know how to do any of those. You can crush me but you
            can't crush my spirit! You're going back for the Countess, aren't
            you? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust
            bosoms.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! This is the worst part.
            The calm before the battle. There's no part of that sentence I
            didn't like! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at
            Elzars. Explain that.

            Red Five standing by. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and
            inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I care. So, what do
            you think of her, Han? What good is a reward if you ain't around to
            use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of
            courage. It's more like…suicide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. All right. Well,
            take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at,
            ain't it? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
            presence of my old master.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I need your
            help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort
            of thing. He is here. The plans you refer to will soon be back in
            our hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and
            ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I
            need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for
            this sort of thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the
            Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Escape is not
            his plan. I must face him, alone. Escape is not his plan. I must
            face him, alone.

            Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Kid, I've flown from one
            side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
            but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one
            all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical
            energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple
            tricks and nonsense.

            Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the
            worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within
            minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Thank you,
            steal again.

            I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart,
            powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Son, a woman is like a
            beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own
            mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink
            another woman!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I
            won't be back for ten minutes! Human contact: the final frontier.
            And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. I'll be back. You
            can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when
            they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

            I didn't get rich by signing checks. No children have ever meddled
            with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. "Thank the
            Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God
            has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place
            within an organized religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to
            tell about it. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic,
            but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower
            taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm
            kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If
            a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!
